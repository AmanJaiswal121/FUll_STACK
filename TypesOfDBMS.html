    <h1>Types of DBMS (Database Management System)</h1>
    <p>
        DBMS is a software that manages the data for efficient storage and fast retrievals of data from database. MySQL,
        IBM Db2, Oracle, PostgreSQL etc. are all DBMS softwares that manages the data.
    </p>
    <h2>Types of DBMS</h2>
    <h3>There are 4 types of DBMS:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1. Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
        </li>
        <li>
            2. Object Oriented Database Management System.
        </li>
        <li>
            3. Hierarchical Database management system.
        </li>
        <li>
            4. Network Database management system.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="color:brown ;">1. Relational Database Management System</h3>
    <p>
        In RDBMS, data is stored in tables, in form of <strong>rows and columns</strong>, where a row represent the
        record of the data
        and column represents the attributes of the record. <br> <br>
        For example, a student table stores the records of various students, a row of this table represents the record
        of a single student and the column represents the attributes of the record such as student id, name, age,
        address etc.
    </p>

    <strong><u>Student table</u></strong>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th style="color: blue;">ID</th>
            <th style="color: blue;">Name</th>
            <th style="color: blue;">Age</th>
            <th style="color: blue;">Address</th>

        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>101</td>
            <td>Ajeet</td>
            <td>28</td>
            <td>Delhi</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>102</td>
            <td>Aman</td>
            <td>21</td>
            <td>Noida</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>103</td>
            <td>Hari</td>
            <td>32</td>
            <td>Pune</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>104</td>
            <td>Rahul</td>
            <td>30</td>
            <td>Agra</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>105</td>
            <td>Sonu</td>
            <td>35</td>
            <td>Noida</td>
        </tr> <br>
        <p>We use SQL to manage, organize and perform various operations on RDBMS.</p>

    <h3 style="color: brown;">2. Object Oriented Database Management System</h3>
    <p>
        Data is stored as objects, attributes and methods. It typically stores and manages objects directly on the
        database server’s disk. There are no tables, no rows, no columns, no foreign keys. There are only objects.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Elements of Object Oriented Database :</strong> <br>
        <strong><u>Object</u> :</strong> It is a combination of data and its behaviour(commonly referred as methods).
        <br>

        <strong>For example :</strong> A house is an object. An object has two characteristics: states and behaviour.
        <br> <br>

        In this example of “House” being an object. The state of “House” is its address, color, area etc. and behaviour
        is Open main door, close main door etc. <br><br>

        An object oriented database can be represented by the following diagram.

    <h3 style="color: brown;">3. Hierarchical Database Management System</h3>
    <p>
        In hierarchical database management system, data is stored in form of one to many relationships. You can
        visualize it like a tree where a root node is attached to several descendants nodes called leaves. <br> <br>
        <strong>Example of Hierarchical database systems are : </strong>IMS by IDM, Windows registry by Microsoft. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>For example : </strong>To store the data of an organization, the <strong>root node</strong> is
        organization itself. The
        immediate <strong>child nodes</strong> are: Employees, Managers, Directors. These child nodes can have further
        child nodes such
        as Employees can have child nodes such as: Engineers, Housekeeping staff, system admin etc.

    <h3 style="color: brown;">4. Network Database Management System</h3>
    <p>
        A network database management system (network DBMS) is based on a network data model, which allows each record
        to be related to multiple primary records and multiple secondary records. <br> <br>

        A network database is based on a traditional hierarchical database, except it allows each object to have
        multiple parents instead of a single parent. This means data in network database can have one to one or one to
        many relationships.
