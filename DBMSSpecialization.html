    <h1>Specialization</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li type="circle">Specialization is a top-down approach, and it is opposite to Generalization. In
            specialization, one higher level entity can be broken down into two lower level entities.</li><br>
        <li type="circle">Specialization is used to identify the subset of an entity set that shares some distinguishing
            characteristics.</li><br>
        <li type="circle">Normally, the superclass is defined first, the subclass and its related attributes are defined
            next, and relationship set are then added.</li><br>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <strong>example, </strong>In an Employee management system, EMPLOYEE entity can be specialized as TESTER or DEVELOPER based on what role they play in the company.
