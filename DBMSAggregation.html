    <h1>Aggregation</h1>
    <p>
        In aggregation, the relation between two entities is treated as a single entity. In aggregation, relationship
        with its corresponding entities is aggregated into a higher level entity. <br>
    </p>
    <strong>example, </strong>Center entity offers the Course entity act as a single entity in the relationship which is
    in a relationship with another entity visitor. In the real world, if a visitor visits a coaching center then he will
    never enquiry about the Course only or just about the Center instead he will ask the enquiry about both. <br>
