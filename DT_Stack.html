    <h1>Stack Data Structure</h1>

    <p>
        A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the <strong>LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)</strong> principle. Stack
        has one end,
        whereas the Queue has two ends (front and rear). It contains only one pointer top pointer pointing to the
        topmost element of the stack. Whenever an element is added in the stack, it is added on the top of the stack,
        and the element can be deleted only from the stack. In other words, a <strong>stack can be defined as a
            container in
            which insertion and deletion can be done from the one end known as the top of the stack</strong>. <br>
    </p><br>

    <h3 id="c">Working of Stack</h3>
    <p>
        Stack works on the LIFO pattern. As we can observe in the below figure there are five memory blocks in the
        stack; therefore, the size of the stack is 5. <br><br>

        Suppose we want to store the elements in a stack and let's assume that stack is empty. We have taken the stack
        of size 5 as shown below in which we are pushing the elements one by one until the stack becomes full. <br>
    </p><br>

    <br>
    <p>
        Since our stack is full as the size of the stack is 5. In the above cases, we can observe that it goes from the
        top to the bottom when we were entering the new element in the stack. The stack gets filled up from the bottom
        to the top. <br><br>

        When we perform the delete operation on the stack, there is only one way for entry and exit as the other end is
        closed. It follows the LIFO pattern, which means that the value entered first will be removed last. In the above
        case, the value 5 is entered first, so it will be removed only after the deletion of all the other elements.
        <br>
    </p><br>

    <h3 id="c">Standard Stack Operations</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>The following are some common operations implemented on the stack :</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li><u style="color: darkolivegreen;">push()<strong></strong></u> : When we insert an element in a stack then
            the operation is known as a push. If the stack is full then the overflow condition occurs.</li><br>
        <li><u style="color: darkolivegreen;">pop()<strong></strong></u> : When we delete an element from the stack, the
            operation is known as a pop. If the stack is empty means that no element exists in the stack, this state is
            known as an underflow state.</li><br>
        <li><u style="color: darkolivegreen;">isEmpty()<strong></strong></u> : It determines whether the stack is empty
            or not.</li><br>
        <li><u style="color: darkolivegreen;">isFull()<strong></strong></u> : It determines whether the stack is full or
            not.</li><br>
        <li><u style="color: darkolivegreen;">peek()<strong></strong></u> : It returns the element at the given
            position.</li><br>
        <li><u style="color: darkolivegreen;">count()<strong></strong></u> : It returns the total number of elements
            available in a stack.</li><br>
        <li><u style="color: darkolivegreen;">change()<strong></strong></u> : It changes the element at the given
            position.</li><br>
        <li><u style="color: darkolivegreen;">display()<strong></strong></u> : It prints all the elements available in
            the stack.</li><br>
    </ul>
    </p>
