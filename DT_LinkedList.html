    <h1>Introduction to Linked List in Data Structures</h1>

    Linked lists are the new data structure we'll explore today. The study of linked lists will certainly be detailed,
    but first, I would like to inform you about one of the fundamental differences between linked lists and arrays.
    <br><br>

    Arrays demand a contiguous memory location. Lengthening an array is not possible. We would have to copy the whole
    array to some bigger memory location to lengthen its size. Similarity inserting or deleting an element causes the
    elements to shift right and left, respectively.<br><br>

    But linked lists are stored in a non-contiguous memory location. To add a new element, we just have to create a node
    somewhere in the memory and get it pointed by the previous element. And deleting an element is just as easy as that.
    We just have to skip pointing to that particular node. Lengthening a linked list is not a big deal.<br><br>
    <br>
    <h3 id="c">Why Linked Lists?</h3>
    <p>
        Memory and the capacity of an array remain fixed, while in linked lists, we can keep adding and removing
        elements without any capacity constraint. <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3 id="c">Types of Linked List</h3>
    <p>Following are the various types of linked list.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color: darkolivegreen;">1. Singly Linked Lists</h3>

    <p>
        Singly linked lists contain two “buckets” in one node; one bucket holds the data and the other bucket holds the
        address of the next node of the list. Traversals can be done in one direction only as there is only a single
        link between two nodes of the same list. <br><br>

    </p>

    <h3 style="color: darkolivegreen;">2. Doubly Linked Lists</h3>

    <p>
        Doubly Linked Lists contain three “buckets” in one node; one bucket holds the data and the other buckets hold
        the addresses of the previous and next nodes in the list. The list is traversed twice as the nodes in the list
        are connected to each other from both sides. <br><br>

            width="415px">
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: darkolivegreen;">3. Circular Linked Lists</h3>

    <p>
        Circular linked lists can exist in both singly linked list and doubly linked list. <br><br>

        Since the last node and the first node of the circular linked list are connected, the traversal in this linked
        list will go on forever until it is broken. <br><br>

    <h3 id="c">Basic Operations in the Linked Lists</h3>
    <p>
        The basic operations in the linked lists are insertion, deletion, searching, display, and deleting an element at
        a given key. These operations are performed on Singly Linked Lists as given below − <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><u>Insertion</u> : </strong>Adds an element at the beginning of the list.</li><br>
            <li><strong><u>Deletion</u> : </strong>Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.</li><br>
            <li><strong><u>Display</u> : </strong>Displays the complete list.</li><br>
            <li><strong><u>Search</u> : </strong>Searches an element using the given key.</li><br>
            <li><strong><u>Delete</u> : </strong>Deletes an element using the given key.</li><br>
        </ul>
    </p><br>

    <h3 id="c">Implementation of Linked Lists</h3>
    <p>Let us look at the implementation of the linked list data structures below −</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linked Lists can be used to implement useful data structures like stacks and queues.</li><br>
            <li>Linked Lists can be used to implement hash tables, each bucket of the hash table can be a linked list.</li><br>
            <li>Linked Lists can be used to implement graphs (Adjacency List representation of graph).</li><br>
            <li>Linked Lists can be used in a refined way in implementing different file systems in one form or another.</li><br>
        </ul>
    </p>
