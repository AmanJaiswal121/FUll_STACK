    <h1>Stack VS Queue</h1><br>

    <h3 id="c">What is a Stack Data Structure</h3>
    <p>
        A stack is a non-primitive, linear data structure that stores the elements in a LIFO (Last In First Out) order.
        However, the stack can only be used to store similar kinds of elements, that is, those that have the same data
        types.
    </p><br>

    <h3 id="c">What Is a Queue Data Structure</h3>
    <p>
        A queue is also a non-primitive, linear data structure that stores elements in a sequential manner. However, the
        queue data structure follows a FIFO (First In First Out) order to store and retrieve elements from the memory.
        It can also only store similar kinds of elements in the queue.
