    <h1>Normalization in dbms</h1>
    <p>Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable
        characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies. Normalization rules divides larger tables into
        smaller tables and links them using relationships. The purpose of Normalisation in SQL is to eliminate redundant
        (repetitive) data and ensure data is stored logically. <br><br>

        The inventor of the relational model Edgar Codd proposed the theory of normalization of data with the
        introduction of the First Normal Form, and he continued to extend theory with Second and Third Normal Form.
        Later he joined Raymond F. Boyce to develop the theory of Boyce-Codd Normal Form. <br>
    </p> <br>

    <h3 id="c">Normalization Rule -</h3>
    <p>Normalization rules are divided into the following normal forms :</p>
    <ul>
        01. First Normal Form <br>
        02. Second Normal Form<br>
        03. Third Normal Form<br>
        04. BCNF<br>
        05. Fourth Normal Form<br>
    </ul> <br>

    <h3 id="c"><u>First Normal Form (1NF)</u></h3>
    <p>For a table to be in the First Normal Form, it should follow the following 4 rules :</p>

    <ul>
        <li>It should only have single(atomic) valued attributes/columns.</li><br>
        <li>Values stored in a column should be of the same domain.</li><br>
        <li>All the columns in a table should have unique names.</li><br>
        <li>And the order in which data is stored, does not matter.</li><br>
    </ul>

    <p><strong style="color: darkolivegreen;">Single Valued Attributes</strong> - </p>
    <p>Each column of your table should be
        single valued which means they should not contain multiple values. We will explain this with help of an example
        later, let's see the other rules for now.</p> <br>

    <h3 id="c"><u>Second Normal Form (2NF)</u></h3>
    <p>For a table to be in the Second Normal Form,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It should be in the First Normal form.</li><br>
        <li>And, it should not have Partial Dependency.</li><br>
    </ul>
    <p><strong style="color: darkolivegreen;">Partial Dependency</strong> - </p>
    <p>
        Now that we know what dependency is, we are in a better state to understand what partial dependency is. <br><br>

        For a simple table like Student, a single column like student_id can uniquely identfy all the records in a
        table. <br><br>

        But this is not true all the time. So now let's extend our example to see if more than 1 column together can act
        as a primary key. <br><br>

        Let's create another table for Subject, which will have subject_id and subject_name fields and subject_id will
        be the primary key.
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th style="color: blue;">subject_id</th>
            <th style="color: blue;">subject_name</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Java</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>C++</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>Php</td>
        </tr>
    </table> <br>
    <p>
        Now we have a <strong>Student</strong> table with student information and another table <strong>Subject</strong>
        for storing subject information. <br>
    </p> <br>


    <h3 id="c"><u>Third Normal Form (3NF)</u></h3>
    <p>
        A table is said to be in the Third Normal Form when,
    <ul>
        <li>It is in the Second Normal form.</li><br>
        <li>And, it doesn't have Transitive Dependency.</li><br>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p style="color: darkolivegreen;"><strong>Transitive Dependency</strong> - </p>
    <p>
        With exam_name and total_marks added to our Score table, it saves more data now. Primary key for our Score table
        is a composite key, which means it's made up of two attributes or columns → <strong>student_id +
            subject_id</strong>. <br><br>

        Our new column exam_name depends on both student and subject. For example, a mechanical engineering student will
        have Workshop exam but a computer science student won't. And for some subjects you have Prctical exams and for
        some you don't. So we can say that exam_name is dependent on both student_id and subject_id.<br><br>

        And what about our second new column total_marks? Does it depend on our Score table's primary key?<br><br>

        Well, the column total_marks depends on exam_name as with exam type the total score changes. For example,
        practicals are of less marks while theory exams are of more marks.<br><br>

        But, exam_name is just another column in the score table. It is not a primary key or even a part of the primary
        key, and total_marks depends on it.<br><br>

        This is <strong>Transitive Dependency</strong>. When a non-prime attribute depends on other non-prime attributes
        rather than
        depending upon the prime attributes or primary key.<br><br>
    </p>

    <h3 id="c"><u>Boyce and Codd Normal Form (BCNF)</u></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Boyce and Codd Normal Form</strong> is a higher version of the Third Normal form. This form deals with
        certain type of
        anomaly that is not handled by 3NF. A 3NF table which does not have multiple overlapping candidate keys is said
        to be in BCNF. For a table to be in BCNF, following conditions must be satisfied:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>R must be in 3rd Normal Form.</li><br>
        <li>and, for each functional dependency ( X → Y ), X should be a super Key.
        </li><br>
    </ul> <br>


    <h3 id="c">Fourth Normal Form (4NF)</h3>

    <p>
        A table is said to be in the Fourth Normal Form when, <br>
    <ul>
        <li>It is in the Boyce-Codd Normal Form.</li><br>
        <li>And, it doesn't have Multi-Valued Dependency.</li><br>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p style="color: darkolivegreen;">Multi-valued Dependency - </p>

    <p>
        Fourth Normal Form comes into picture when Multi-valued Dependency occur in any relation. In this tutorial we
        will learn about Multi-valued Dependency, how to remove it and how to make any table satisfy the fourth normal
        form. <br><br>
        A table is said to have multi-valued dependency, if the following conditions are true, <br><br>

        01. For a dependency A → B, if for a single value of A, multiple value of B exists, then the table may have
        multi-valued dependency. <br><br>
        02. Also, a table should have at-least 3 columns for it to have a multi-valued dependency. <br><br>
        03. And, for a relation R(A,B,C), if there is a multi-valued dependency between, A and B, then B and C should be
        independent of each other. <br><br>
        If all these conditions are true for any relation(table), it is said to have multi-valued dependency. <br>
