    <h1>DBMS Keys</h1>
    <h3 style="color: blue;">What are Keys in DBMS?</h3>

    <p>
        KEYS in DBMS is an attribute or set of attributes which helps you to identify a row(tuple) in a relation(table).
        They allow you to find the relation between two tables. Keys help you uniquely identify a row in a table by a
        combination of one or more columns in that table. Key is also helpful for finding unique record or row from the
        table. Database key is also helpful for finding unique record or row from the table. <br>
    </p> <br>

    <h3 id="c">Different Types Of Keys in DBMS -</h3>
    <p>There are following 10 important keys in DBMS -</p>

    <!-- Super key -->


    <h3 style="color: darkblue;">01. <u>Super Key</u> - </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>A super key is a set of attributes that can identify each tuple uniquely in the given relation.</li> <br>
        <li>A super key is not restricted to have any specific number of attributes.</li><br>
        <li>Thus, a super key may consist of any number of attributes.</li><br>
    </ul>
    <u>eg.</u> - <br>
    Consider the following Student schema - <br>
    <ul>
        <h5>Student ( roll , name , sex , age , address , class , section )</h5>
    </ul><br>
    <u>NOTES</u> - <br><br>
    All the attributes in a super key are definitely sufficient to identify each tuple uniquely in the given relation
    but all of them may not be necessary. <br><br>


    <!-- Candidate Key -->


    <h3 style="color: darkblue;">02. <u>Candidate Key</u> - </h3>

    <ul>
        A minimal super key is called as a candidate key. <br>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: center;">OR</p>
    <ul>
        A set of minimal attribute(s) that can identify each tuple uniquely in the given relation is called as a
        candidate key. <br>
    </ul>

    <u>eg.</u> - <br>
    Consider the following Student schema - <br>
    <ul>
        <h5>Student ( roll , name , sex , age , address , class , section )</h5>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <u>NOTES</u> -
    <ul>
        <li>All the attributes in a candidate key are sufficient as well as necessary to identify each tuple uniquely.
        </li><br>
        <li>Removing any attribute from the candidate key fails in identifying each tuple uniquely.</li><br>
        <li>The value of candidate key must always be unique.</li><br>
        <li>The value of candidate key can never be NULL.</li><br>
        <li>It is possible to have multiple candidate keys in a relation.</li><br>
        <li>Those attributes which appears in some candidate key are called as prime attributes.</li><br>
    </ul>


    <!-- Primary key -->


    <h3 style="color: darkblue;">03. <u>Primary Key</u> - </h3>

    <ul>A primary key is a candidate key that the database designer selects while designing the database.</ul>
    <p style="text-align: center;">OR</p>
    <ul>Candidate key that the database designer implements is called as a primary key.</ul>
    <br>
    <u>NOTES</u> -
    <ul>
        <li>The value of primary key can never be NULL.</li><br>
        <li>The value of primary key must always be unique.</li><br>
        <li>The values of primary key can never be changed i.e. no updation is possible.</li><br>
        <li>The value of primary key must be assigned when inserting a record.</li><br>
        <li>A relation is allowed to have only one primary key.</li>
    </ul> <br>

    <!-- Alternate Key -->


    <h3 style="color: darkblue;">04. <u>Alternate Key</u> - </h3>

    <ul>Candidate keys that are left unimplemented or unused after implementing the primary key are called as alternate
        keys.</ul>
    <p style="text-align: center;">OR</p>
    <ul>Unimplemented candidate keys are called as alternate keys.</ul>
    <br>



    <!-- Foreign Key -->

    <h3 style="color: darkblue;">05. <u>Foreign Key</u> - </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>An attribute ‘X’ is called as a foreign key to some other attribute ‘Y’ when its values are dependent on the
            values of attribute ‘Y’.</li><br>
        <li>The attribute ‘X’ can assume only those values which are assumed by the attribute ‘Y’.</li><br>
        <li>Here, the relation in which attribute ‘Y’ is present is called as the referenced relation.</li><br>
        <li>The relation in which attribute ‘X’ is present is called as the referencing relation.</li><br>
        <li>The attribute ‘Y’ might be present in the same table or in some other table.</li><br>
    </ul>

    <u>eg.</u> - <br><br>
    Consider the following two schemas- <br>

    <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1828" title="Foreign Key"
        src="https://www.gatevidyalay.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Foreign-Key.png"
        sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px"
        srcset="https://www.gatevidyalay.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Foreign-Key.png 751w, https://www.gatevidyalay.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Foreign-Key-300x86.png 300w"
        alt="" width="400" height="216"> <br>
    <p>
        Here, t_dept can take only those values which are present in dept_no in Department table since only those
        departments actually exist. <br>
    </p> <br>

    <u>NOTES</u> - <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Foreign key references the primary key of the table.</li><br>
        <li>Foreign key can take only those values which are present in the primary key of the referenced relation.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Foreign key may have a name other than that of a primary key.</li><br>
        <li>Foreign key can take the NULL value.</li><br>
        <li>There is no restriction on a foreign key to be unique.</li><br>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <!--  Partial Key -->

    <h3 style="color: darkblue;">06. <u>Partial Key</u> - </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Partial key is a key using which all the records of the table can not be identified uniquely.</li><br>
        <li>However, a bunch of related tuples can be selected from the table using the partial key.</li><br>
    </ul>

    <u>eg.</u> - <br>
    <p>Consider the following schema -</p>
    <ul>
        <h5>Department ( Emp_no , Dependent_name , Relation )</h5>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th style="color: blue;">Emp_no</th>
            <th style="color: blue;">Dependent_name</th>
            <th style="color: blue;">Relation</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>E1</td>
            <td>Suman</td>
            <td>Mother</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>E1</td>
            <td>Ajay</td>
            <td>Father</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>E2</td>
            <td>Vijay</td>
            <td>Father</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>E3</td>
            <td>Ankush</td>
            <td>Son</td>
        </tr>
    </table> <br>
    <p>Here, using partial key Emp_no, we can not identify a tuple uniquely but we can select a bunch of tuples from the
        table.</p>
    <br>


    <!-- Composite Key -->


    <h3 style="color: darkblue;">07. <u>Composite Key</u> - </h3>
    <p>A primary key comprising of multiple attributes and not just a single attribute is called as a composite key.</p>
    <br>


    <!-- Unique Key -->

    <h3 style="color: darkblue;">08. <u>Unique Key</u> - </h3>
    <p>The best example of unique key is Adhaar Card Numbers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Adhaar Card Number is unique for all the citizens (tuples) of India (table).</li><br>
        <li>If it gets lost and another duplicate copy is issued, then the duplicate copy always has the same number as
            before.</li><br>
        <li>Thus, it is non-updatable.</li><br>
        <li>Few citizens may not have got their Adhaar cards, so for them its value is NULL.</li><br>
    </ul>


    <!--  Surrogate Key -->

    <h3 style="color: darkblue;">09. <u>Surrogate Key</u> - </h3>
    <p>
        Surrogate key is a key with the following properties -
    </p> 
    <ul>
        <li>It is unique for all the records of the table.</li><br>
        <li>It is updatable.</li><br>
        <li>It can not be NULL i.e. it must have some value.</li><br>
    </ul> 
    <u>eg.</u> - <br><br>
    Mobile Number of students in a class where every student owns a mobile phone. <br><br>


    <!-- Secondary Key -->


    <h3 style="color: darkblue;">10. <u>Secondary Key</u> - </h3>
    <p>Secondary key is required for the indexing purpose for better and faster searching.</p>
