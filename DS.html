    <h1>Data Structures</h1>

    <h3 id="c" style="color: blue;">What is Data Structure :</h3>
    <p>A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a
        computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. <br><br>
        A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and
        storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every
        program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures.

    <h3 id="c">Data structures are an essential concept in computer science and programming. Here are some reasons why
        they are important:</h3>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <span style="color: darkolivegreen;">1. <u>Efficient data processing</u> :</span> Data structures provide a way
        to organize and store data in a way that allows for
        efficient retrieval, manipulation, and storage of data. For example, using a hash table to store data can
        provide constant-time access to data. <br><br>

        <span style="color: darkolivegreen;">2. <u>Memory management</u> :</span> Proper use of data structures can help
        to reduce memory usage and optimize the use of
        resources. For example, using dynamic arrays can allow for more efficient use of memory than using static
        arrays. <br><br>
        <span style="color: darkolivegreen;">3. <u>Code reusability</u> :</span> Data structures can be used as building
        blocks in various algorithms and programs, making it
        easier to reuse code. <br><br>
        <span style="color: darkolivegreen;">4. <u>Abstraction</u> :</span> Data structures provide a level of
        abstraction that allows programmers to focus on the logical
        structure of the data and the operations that can be performed on it, rather than on the details of how the data
        is stored and manipulated. <br><br>
        <span style="color: darkolivegreen;">5. <u>Algorithm design</u> :</span> Many algorithms rely on specific data
        structures to operate efficiently. Understanding data
        structures is crucial for designing and implementing efficient algorithms. <br><br>
    </ul>
    </p> <br>

    <h3 id="c">linear data structure</h3>
    <p>
        A linear data structure is one where data items are arranged in a linear fashion. Each member is attached to its
        neighboring elements. The structure permits single-level data storage because the data elements are stored in a
        linear fashion. The data can be traversed in one run. A linear data structure does not maximize memory.
        <br><br>
        A linear data structure is one where data items are ordered either sequentially or in a linear fashion, and each
        member is attached to its neighboring elements. The linear data structure's elements can all be accessed in one
        run. There are four primary types of linear data structures: Queue, Linked Lists, Stack, and Arrays.
    </p>
    <br>


    <h3 id="c">Non-linear data structure</h3>
    <p>
        In the Linear and Non Linear Data Structure, the non-linear data structure is the data system where data things
        aren’t structured sequentially known as non-linear data structure. Put simply, A data component of the
        non-linear data system may be hooked up to much more than one component to reflect a specific connection among
        them. All of the data components in a non-linear data system can’t be traversed in a single run.
        <br><br>
        In Linear and Non Linear Data Structure, a Non-linear data structure is a data structure where data things
        aren’t stored linearly in the mind. Therefore there’s no contiguous mind allocation of the data. This particular
        function is provided since it uses memory well.
        <br><br>
        In Linear and Non Linear Data Structure, A non-linear data structure is yet another crucial key in which data
        components aren’t arranged sequentially; primarily, data elements are set up in random order without developing
        a linear structure.
